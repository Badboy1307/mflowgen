README: Setting up the Innovus Foundation Flow

Look at the "Innovus Foundation Flow Guide" (innovusflowSetup.pdf). To
begin installing the foundation flow, it says in this document to run the
following:

    % innovus -64 -no_gui
    > writeFlowTemplate

This will put the flow into the current directory. Then you can create a
setup tcl file that customizes the flow.

Creating a setup.tcl
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look into `TEMPLATES/INNOVUS/setup.tcl` for an example of a setup file.

I created a completely new setup file and only ported in what I wanted. I
am basically going through the "TCL Variables -- Describing setup.tcl"
section of the Innovus Foundation Flow Guide and deciding which variables
we want to use. I also looked at the Celerity setup.tcl for reference.
