C-2009.06-SP2
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime 
Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP2.

*  Changes have been made to the settings for preexisting options in the RMgen 
   graphical user interface (GUI) configuration:

   o  The Analysis Type option has been removed.

   o  The Use Multiple Constraint Files option has been removed and the 
      Advanced OCV Mode option has been changed to a primary option.
   
      Previously, the Advanced OCV Mode option was a secondary option that was 
      available only when the Use Multiple Constraint Files option was set to TRUE.

      The script now contains a CONSTRAINT_FILES variable that you can use to list 
      all of your constraint files. The USE_MULTIPLE_CONSTRAINTS_FILES and 
      SINGLE_CONSTRAINT_FILE variables have been removed from the script.

*  Constraint files can be either Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC) files or 
   tool command language (Tcl) files.
   
   The file type is identified by the file name extension. The PrimeTime Reference 
   Methodology now supports both types of constraint files.

*  For Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA) runs, you can now set the 
   derating variables by entering numeric values. For example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_clock_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09

   In previous versions, the mode and corner had to be embedded in the value. For
   example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value "mode1_corner1_1.09 mode2_corner1_1.20"


C-2009.06-SP1

      changed to USED_IN_DESIGN.

   o  The default in the GUI for CRPR_MODE is now POST,  in prior releases
      it was PRE.

   o  The CRPR_THRESHOLD variable has been removed.

   o  The following DERATE variables have been removed:

      1. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_CLOCK
      2. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_DATA
      3. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_EARLY	
      4. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_LATE

      The new DERATE variables are:

      1. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_EARLY
      2. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_LATE
      3. DERATE_MODE_DATA_EARLY	
      4. DERATE_MODE_DATA_LATE

      This produces up to four set_timing_derate statements in the 
      generated scripts.
