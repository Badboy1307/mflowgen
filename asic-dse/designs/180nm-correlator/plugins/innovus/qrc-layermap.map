# This mapping is between qrcTechFile layer names and LEF layer names.
# Open the .ict file that comes with the qrcTechFile and open the routing
# technology kit tech LEF. If the names do not match (e.g., "METAL1" vs
# "METAL_1"), then we need this map.
#
# Innovus tries to generate a mapping automatically when QRC extraction is
# run and dumps this file with the best mapping it can make inside of the
# extLogDir generated directory. This file was created by using that
# template and then comparing the .ict and .lef to map the layer names
# together. This is also how Cadence support advises doing the mapping.
